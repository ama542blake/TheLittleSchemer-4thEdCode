# TheLittleSchemer 4thEdCode
 Implementation of the code in the 4th edition of The Little Schemer by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.

All the functions the book challenges the reader to write. I figure this will be helpful to people who want to experiment with the functions once they understand them, but do not want to write them out themselves. Some of these have slightly different implementations than in the book, but they should all work the same. Please contact me if they do not.
